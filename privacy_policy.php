                <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
                <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Aswath Naturale Pvt Ltd / Herbhari (“Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”)
                    collects, uses, discloses, and protects your personal data when you visit <a
                        href="http://www.herbhari.com">www.herbhari.com</a> or purchase our products. The Policy is
                    designed to align with the principles of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 and relevant
                    rules, as applicable.</p>

                <h4>2. Personal Data We Collect</h4>
                <p>We may collect personal data that you provide directly, such as name, contact number, email address,
                    billing and shipping address, and payment‑related information when you create an account or place an
                    order. We may also collect technical data such as IP address, device information, browser type, and
                    usage data through cookies and similar technologies for analytics and security purposes.</p>

                <h4>3. Purpose and Legal Basis of Processing</h4>
                <p>We process your personal data to fulfil your orders, provide customer support, manage payments and
                    refunds, and deliver products and services you request. We also process data to improve our website,
                    personalize user experience, send transactional and (where permitted) marketing communications,
                    comply with legal obligations, and prevent fraud and security incidents.</p>

                <h4>4. Consent and Your Choices</h4>
                <p>Where required, we obtain your consent before processing your personal data for specific purposes,
                    such as sending promotional emails or using certain cookies. You may withdraw your consent at any
                    time by following the unsubscribe instructions in communications or by contacting us, but this will
                    not affect processing based on consent before withdrawal.</p>

                <h4>5. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h4>
                <p>Our website may use cookies, pixels, and similar technologies to remember your preferences,
                    understand how you use the Website, and improve services. You can manage cookie settings through
                    your browser, but disabling certain cookies may affect Website functionality.</p>

                <h4>6. Sharing of Personal Data</h4>
                <p>We may share your personal data with trusted third parties such as payment processors, courier and
                    logistics partners, IT service providers, marketing service providers, and marketplace platforms,
                    strictly for the purposes described in this Policy. Such third parties are expected to implement
                    appropriate security measures and process data only in accordance with applicable law and our
                    instructions.</p>

                <h4>7. Cross‑Border Data Transfers</h4>
                <p>If your data is transferred outside India (for example, where servers or service providers are
                    located abroad), we will take reasonable steps to ensure that the recipient implements comparable
                    data protection standards, subject to applicable law and government notifications.</p>

                <h4>8. Data Retention</h4>
                <p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Policy,
                    including satisfying legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. After the retention period, data
                    will be deleted or anonymized in a secure manner, except where law requires longer retention.</p>

                <h4>9. Data Security</h4>
                <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data
                    against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of

                <h4>13. Updates to this Policy</h4>
                <p>We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in legal requirements,
                    technology, or our practices, and the updated version will be posted on the Website with a “Last
                    Updated” date. Continued use of the Website after such changes will be deemed acceptance of the
