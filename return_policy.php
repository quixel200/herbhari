                <p>Thank you for shopping with Aswath Naturale Pvt Ltd at our website <a
                        href="http://www.herbhari.com">www.herbhari.com</a> ("Company", "we", "us", "our"). This Returns
                    & Refund Policy explains when and how customers can return products or request refunds for purchases
                    made on our website www.herbhari.com.</p>
                <p>Because we deal with health, wellness and food products, returns are restricted for safety and
                    hygiene reasons, as explained below.</p>

                <hr class="my-4">

                <h4>1. General Principle – No Returns for Opened / Used Products</h4>
                <p>Due to the perishable and consumable nature of many of our products (such as A2 Desi Cow Ghee, Gir
                    cow ghee, health mixes, edible oils, etc.), we do not accept returns of products that have been
                    opened, used, tampered with, or whose original packaging or seal is broken, except in cases of
                    damage, defect or wrong product delivered.</p>
                <p>Personal care and wellness items (such as hair oils, powders, herbal preparations) are also not
                    returnable once opened, for hygiene and safety reasons.</p>

                <h4>2. Eligibility for Return / Replacement</h4>
                <p>You may be eligible for a return or replacement <strong>only</strong> in the following situations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You received a damaged or leaked product at the time of delivery.</li>
                    <li>You received a wrong product (different from what you ordered).</li>
                    <li>The product is expired or near expiry on the date of delivery.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In all such cases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must raise a complaint within <strong>24–48 hours</strong> of delivery, with clear
                        photos/videos of:
                        <ul>
                            <li>the outer packaging,</li>
                            <li>the product label showing batch number and MRP, and</li>
                            <li>the damage/issue itself.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The product must be unused and, where possible, in its original packaging.</li>
                    <li>We reserve the right to refuse returns if the issue is not reported within the specified time,
                        or if evidence is insufficient.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Non‑Returnable / Non‑Refundable Items</h4>
                <p>Unless they are defective, damaged in transit, or incorrectly supplied, the following categories are
                    not eligible for return or refund:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Opened, used or partially consumed food or wellness products.</li>
                    <li>Products damaged due to misuse, improper storage, or negligence after delivery.</li>
                    <li>Products with tampered or missing labels, batch numbers or original packaging.</li>
                    <li>Products bought during special sales, promotions or clearance, where it is specifically
                        mentioned that returns are not allowed.</li>
                    <li>Free gifts, samples or promotional items.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Time Window for Raising Requests</h4>
                <p>For damaged, defective, wrong or expired products: You must raise a return/refund request within
                    <strong>24–48 hours</strong> from the date and time of delivery.
                </p>
                <p>Requests received after this window may be rejected, as the condition of the product cannot be
                    verified reliably.</p>

                <h4>5. How to Raise a Return / Refund Request</h4>
                <p>To initiate a return or refund request:</p>

                            <li>Order ID,</li>
                            <li>Product name and quantity,</li>
                            <li>Date and time of delivery,</li>
                            <li>Clear photos/videos of the product, packaging, and issue.</li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our team / official will review your request and update you on approval, rejection, or need for more
                    information.</p>
                <p>We may request you to return the product or dispose of it safely, depending on the situation.</p>

                <h4>6. Return Shipping</h4>
                <p>In cases where we ask you to physically return the product (for inspection or other reasons), we will
                    inform you whether:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a pickup will be arranged by our courier partner in case your purchase our products on Amazon
                        and other e commerce platforms, or</li>
                    <li>you need to ship it back yourself to a specified address.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the return is due to our error (wrong, damaged, or expired item), we will typically bear or
                    reimburse reasonable return shipping charges.</p>
                <p>If the return is due to reasons attributable to the customer (e.g., incorrect address, refusal to
                    accept delivery without valid reason), we may deduct forward and/or return shipping charges from any
                    refund, as per our discretion.</p>

                <h4>7. Inspection and Approval</h4>
                <p>All returned or claimed products are subject to quality and damage inspection.</p>
                <p>A refund or replacement will be processed only after we verify the issue (through returned goods or
                    adequate photo/video proof).</p>
                <p>If the product does not pass inspection or the claim is found to be invalid, we may decline the
                    return or refund.</p>

                <h4>8. Refund Process and Timelines</h4>
                <p>Once your return/refund request is approved:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refunds will be processed to your original method of payment (credit/debit card, UPI, net
                        banking, wallet, etc.) or as store credit, as applicable.</li>
                    <li>Depending on your bank or payment provider, it may take 5–10 business days for the amount to be
                        reflected in your account.</li>
                    <li>We will notify you via email/SMS/WhatsApp when the refund has been initiated.</li>
                    <li>Any deductions towards shipping fees, COD charges or other applicable charges will be clearly
                        communicated.</li>

                <h4>9. Order Cancellations</h4>

                    <li>If the order has already been shipped, it cannot usually be cancelled due to the perishable
                        nature of many products; in such cases, our regular Returns & Refund Policy will apply.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>10. Orders via Other Marketplaces</h4>

                    policies and timelines.</p>
